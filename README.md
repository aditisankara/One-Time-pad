# One-Time-pad

The One-Time Pad Algorithm (also known as the Vernam Cipher) is an encryption technique which is
used to transfer messages from the sender to a receiver. The message is encoded using a key and then sent
across. The key is a secret one shared only between the sender and receiver that is then used to crack the
encoded message to reveal the real message. Thus without the accurate key, it would be impossible to
decode the message.

- encrypt.cpp : encrypts the plaintext using the key and stores the encrypted message in a file
- decrypt.cpp : decrypts the message
